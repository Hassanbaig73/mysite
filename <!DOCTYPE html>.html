        Let's start off with Sanliurfa. Home of Gobekli Tepe, the oldest human structure in history, dating back 9500 BC. 
        Thirty minutes away from Gobekli Tepe is another historic site. The reputed birthplace of Abraham, Balikligol.

        <h1> ISTANBUL </h1>
        <img src="alt=">
        My journey ended with Istanbul, a city which needs no introduction. 
        From Aga Sofia to Eyup Sultan, ancient Byzantine ruins of Constantinople, the evolution of history can be seen through this transcontinental city.
        In my two weeks there, I would cross the Bosphorous daily, hopping in between Europe and Asia.
