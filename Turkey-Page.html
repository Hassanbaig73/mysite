        <h1> SANLIURFA </h1>
        <img src="Urfafirstpic.jpeg"alt="" width="300" height="auto"/>
        Let's start off with Sanliurfa. Home of Gobekli Tepe, the oldest human structure in history, dating back 9500 BC. 
        Thirty minutes away from Gobekli Tepe is another historic site. The reputed birthplace of Abraham, Balikligol.
        Being so close to the Syrian border, this city has a vast mix of Turkish, Kurdish and Syrian cultures.

         Pictured above is Mount Nimrod. Named after King Nimrod from the Biblical and Quranic traditions. This is still a mainly Kurdish province but

        <h1> DIYARBAKAR </h1>
        <img src="diyarbakir firstpic.jpeg"alt=" width="300" height="auto"/>
        Diyarbakar is the largest Kurdish majority city in Turkey. 
        The turkish I'd slowly been picking up along the way wasn't much use here.
        But the difference in the culture, language and cuisine was all very refreshing. 
        I wasn't here long enough to learn Kurdish, but I learnt 'zebeşê te heye' meaning 'do you have watermelon?' which is all you really need to know.

        <h1> KONYA </h1>
        <img src="konya first pic.jpeg"alt=" width="300" height="auto"/>
        The historic centre of Sufism, attracting tourists and pilgrims from around the world, paying respects to the great Sufi poet Maulana Jalaludin, known in the west as simply Rumi.
        Also buried next to Rumi, is his teacher, mentor and best friend Shams-e-Tabriz. 
        The famed Whirling Dervishes are based in Konya. The mystical dance of spirituality taught by Rumi as a means of ascension to higher states of being.

        <h1> BURSA </h1>
        <img src="Bursa firstpic.jpeg"alt=" width="300" height="auto"/>
        Bursa, the historic capital of the Ottoman Empire, is home to Osman, the founder and namesake of the Ottoman Empire.
        Home to Uluda, a mountain in the centre of the city which the rest of the city was initially built around.
        In the same area is Ulu Camii, a mosque dating back to the 15th Century.

        <h1> ISTANBUL </h1>
        <img src="Istanbul firstpic.jpeg"alt=" width="300" height="auto"/>
        My journey ended with Istanbul, a city which needs no introduction. 
        From Aga Sofia to Eyup Sultan, ancient Byzantine ruins of Constantinople, the evolution of history can be seen through this transcontinental city.
        In my two weeks there, I would cross the Bosphorous daily, hopping in between Europe and Asia.
